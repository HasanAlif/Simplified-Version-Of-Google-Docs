  // It takes an array of class values and merges them into a single string
  // This is useful for conditionally applying Tailwind CSS classes and ensuring that conflicting classes are resolved correctly
  // The twMerge function is used to handle Tailwind CSS class merging while clsx is used to handle conditional class names
  // This allows for cleaner and more maintainable class name management
  // The function returns a single string of class names that can be used in React components or other places where class names are needed
  // It helps to avoid class name conflicts and ensures that the final class string is optimized for performance and readability
  // This utility function is commonly used in projects that utilize Tailwind CSS and need to manage dynamic class names effectively
  // It can be used in various components to apply styles conditionally and to ensure that the final class string is clean and optimized
  // This function is a simple utility that enhances the developer experience by providing a way to manage class names in a more efficient manner
  // It can be imported and used in any part of the application where class names need to be managed
  // This utility is particularly useful in React applications where class names are often conditionally applied based on component state or props
  // It helps to keep the codebase clean and maintainable by providing a consistent way to handle class names across the application
  // This function can be extended or modified as needed to fit the specific needs of the project or team
  // It can also be used in conjunction with other utility functions to create a more comprehensive styling solution
  return twMerge(clsx(inputs)) // Merges the class names using twMerge and clsx
